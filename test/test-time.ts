/**
 * The following tests are only interesting in the following perspective:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Is the number of games the correct one?</li>
 *     <li>Is the time comparable to the last times when the tests were executed?</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * I had first problems to write those tests, and then found the following issue:
 * https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/1691 which references https://mochajs.org/#asynchronous-code
 *
 * This explains in detail why and how to use the done function provided by mocha.
 * Be aware, that the bigger game files `twic-02-2885games.pgn` and `twic1333-9072games.pgn` are ~10MB.
 * I wanted to avoid those, and have therefore not committed and pushed them. The tests are only done
 * locally on my computer, to check if bigger files work sufficient well (which works).
